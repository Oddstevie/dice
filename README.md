# dice!
The user begins with $100.
If the user rolls any combination of 7 or 11 the user automatically wins.
If the user rolls a 2, 3, or 12, the user automatically loses.
If the user rolls any other combination, then it establishes a point.
If, with the point established, that point is rolled again before a 7,2,3, or 12 the user wins.
If, with the point established, a 7 is rolled before the point is rolled again, the user loses. This is called “seven out.”
If the user loses all their money, the game ends.
